### üëìStoic winery API backend project description

Development repository with all commits - https://github.com/ArtemMakovskyy/wine-store-app

With the Wine Store API, you can:

* View all wines that will be sorted by rating.
* View the wine card and its detailed information.
* Leave a review of the wine and give it a rating. When a user leaves a rating, it is calculated as the average score of
  the last hundred ratings plus 0.01 for each rating. If a user repeatedly submits a review for the same type of wine,
  the old review is deleted and a new one is added. This is done to eliminate duplication and cheating of ratings.
* View customer reviews and their ratings.
* Place an order for wine.
* Receive information about us in Telegram, send a message to the manager, receive links to sorted wine collections.
  Register by inserting your order number and receive order notifications. To correspond with the manager, the manager
  must first be registered in the database.
* As a store administrator, you can give the user manager rights.
* As a manager, you can: add wine cards, change their photos, and also delete wines.
* The administrator and manager require registration on the site; the user can use the resource without registration.
  When placing an order or adding a review, there will be a simplified registration.
* There is also a logout function.
* Once the API is running, you can use the controller's detailed documentation. Link to
  launch: http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/. Default admin credential: login - admin12345@gmail.com,
  password - 12345. Default manager credential: login - manager12345@gmail.com, password - 12345.

# Observability

The project implements an observability system that enables real-time monitoring of metrics, logs, and traces. This allows for effective issue detection, performance analysis, and debugging.

## üîß Tools and Technologies Used

| Component                | Purpose |
|--------------------------|---------|
| **Spring Boot Actuator** | Exposes technical endpoints for gathering application state information |
| **Micrometer + Prometheus** | Collects metrics (CPU usage, memory, HTTP requests, etc.) |
| **Grafana** | Builds dashboards and visualizes metrics |
| **Loki** | Aggregates and displays logs from the Java application via Grafana |
| **Tempo** | Collects traces (distributed tracing) for request analysis across components |
| **Zipkin Brave** | A tracing tool (Zipkin format) with Tempo support |
| **Loki Logback Appender** | Sends logs from Spring Boot to Loki via Logback |

## üöÄ How to Use

### Open Grafana:
- URL: [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)
- By default, anonymous access is enabled with administrator privileges.

### Metrics:
1. Navigate to **Metrics ‚Üí Prometheus**.
2. View relevant metrics such as:
- `http_server_requests_seconds_count`
- `jvm_memory_used_bytes`

### Logs:
1. Go to **Explore ‚Üí Loki**.
2. Filter logs using queries:
- `{app="wine-store-api"}`
- `{level="ERROR"}`

### Traces:
1. Open **Traces ‚Üí Tempo**.
2. Select a service and inspect the request path for **end-to-end tracing**.
